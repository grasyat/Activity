                    <h1>The Great Wall of China</h1>
                    <p>The Great Wall of China is the longest wall in the world! The Chinese national symbol was built
                        by several dynasties (ruling families) over hundreds of years (nearly 1,800), starting in about
                        220 BC. The wall was built to defend areas from invasions and had watchtowers built on the
                        highest places. The famous landmark is actually made up of lots of overlapping walls that
                        measure a combined length of up to 20,000 kilometres. Millions of people visit the Wonder every
                        year.</p>

                    <h1> Taj Mahal, India</h1>
                    <p>This magnificent landmark took 16 years and 20,000 workers to build! It was commissioned to
                        be
                        built
                        in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan with the purpose of housing the tomb of his wife, Mumtaz.
                        Architecturally, the building represents symmetry and balance, and the colour of the
                        exterior
                        marble
                        walls change depending on the time of day. In the morning sun, the white marble looks a
                        shade of
                        pink. During the evening, it looks the colour of milk and looks golden at night when lit by
                        the
                        moon. Because the Taj Mahal commemorates Shah Jahan’s love for Mumtaz, couples like to have
                        their
                        photographs taken with the building in the background.</p>

                    <h1> Petra, Jordan</h1>
                    <p>Petra is an ancient city carved into rock. It is thought that it was built over 2,000 years
                        ago
                        by a
                        group of people who lived in the Wadi Musa valley, called the Nabateans. However, not much
                        is
                        known
                        about the Nabateans. The city fell to the Roman Empire in AD 106 and an earthquake in AD 363
                        damaged
                        the
                        city, which resulted in it eventually falling into disuse. The city ruins were rediscovered
                        in
                        1812
                        by a
                        Swiss explorer called Johann Burckhardt.</p>

                    <h1>The Colosseum, Italy</h1>
                    <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was built between AD 70 and AD 80. It
                        was
                        used
                        for
                        gladiator fights, animal hunts and public executions for four centuries. The floor could
                        also be
                        flooded
                        in order to stage sea battles! Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the architectural
                        masterpiece
                        was
                        actually used as a housing complex. Then, in 1349, a great earthquake destroyed parts of the
                        structure.
                        Despite the damage done over the years, it remains an incredibly popular tourist attraction
                        today.

                    <p>Christ the Redeemer is a statue located at the summit of Corcovado Mountain overlooking Rio
                        de
                        Janeiro in
                        Brazil. The statue shows Jesus Christ with his arms spread out over the city. The statue is
                        30
                        metres
                        tall, with an arm span of the statue is 28 metres!

                        The structure is the newest wonder, having been completed in 1931. At the time of its
                        construction,
                        Brazil was a predominantly Catholic country, and images of the Christ statue were spread
                        throughout.

                    <h1> Chichén Itzá, Mexico</h1>
                    <p>Chichén Itzá was a city built by The Maya people over 1,500 years ago. The city was an
                        important
                        political and economic centre for The Maya people. You’ll find the Temple of Kukulkán (named
                        after
                        the
                        serpent deity), sometimes also referred to as El Castillo, there. It has 91 steps on each of
                        its
                        four
                        sides. An extra step was added at the top of the temple to total 365 steps – one for each
                        day of
                        the
                        year. The top of the temple features a carving of Kukulkán.</p>

                    <h1> Machu Picchu, Peru</h1>
                    <p>Machu Picchu is the ruins of a city from the Incan empire that was built in the 15th century.
                        The
                        ruins
                        are in the Andes Mountains, over 2,000 metres above sea level. Its walls and other
                        architectural
                        elements are cut into the natural rock.

                        It’s not certain why the city was first built, although some sources suggest it was used as
                        a
                        royal
                        retreat for the emperor, Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui. It is thought to have been used between
                        the
                        15th
                        and
                        16th centuries, but was gradually abandoned over time. Today, it is a very popular tourist
                        site,
                        so
                        much
                        so that the Peruvian government has begun limiting the amount of people able to visit each
                        year
                        to
                        preserve it.</p>
